3.069     2015-07-09 10:44:08+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Ignore hidden networks when processing static routes and NAT 
   for networks of aggregates.
 - Fixed owner of auto-interfaces in users-user rules.
 - Fixed 'misc/anonymize'.

3.068     2015-06-29 13:33:46+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Attribute 'peer-id-validate nocheck' of tunnel-group ipsec-attributes
   is no longer printed for certificates, but only for preshared key.
 - NAT attributes are inherited from matching aggregate and supernet
   to matching subnets in zone.
   - Attribute 'nat' can now be defined for matching aggregates.
     It is inherited to all matching networks inside corresponding zone.
   - Attribute 'nat' of supernet N is inherited now to all subnets S of N
     inside corresponding zone. Subnet relation between N and S 
     is determined without consideration of NAT inside zone.
 - Added check for useless identity NAT.
 - Fixed add-to-netspoc / remove-from-netspoc for occurence after
   negation or intersection.

3.067     2015-06-22 13:35:39+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Changes in generated crypto code for ASA:
   - Always add tunnel-group-map if authentication=rsasig.
     This is needed even for tunnel-group having IP address as name.
   - Add route to reach VPN software clients.
 - Moved program bin/export-netspoc from package Netspoc-Web
   into this package.
 - Option 'check_transient_supernet_rules' is activated by default.
   Category is set to 'warn'.
 - Revert changes in subroutine 'expand_protocols'.
   This broke commands print-service and export-netspoc.
 - No longer support isolated and promiscuous ports.

3.066     2015-06-11 13:36:34+02:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Changes in generated crypto code for ASA:
   - Added support for dynamic crypto map.
     Dynamic crypto map is generated at crypto hub, 
     if corresponding crypto spoke has no known IP address.
   - No longer print 'chain' command in tunnel-group.
   - Added isakmp attribute 'ike_version = 2' 
     to activate IKEv2 in site-to-site VPN.
   - Added missing 'ikev1' in 'crypto ipsec transform-set'.
   - ISAKMP commands are not printed any longer, because
     Netspoc-Approve will ignore them anyway.
 - General crypto changes:   
   - Keywords sha256, sha384, sha512 are accepted now.
   - Syntax change: Use md5, sha instead of md5_hmac, sha_hmac.
   - DH groups 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 24 are accepted now.
 - Model name 'IOS_FW' isn't supported any longer. Use 'IOS, FW' instead.
 - No longer support attribute no_in_acl at zone and std_in_acl at router.
 - Src-range is stored in rules again instead of protocol.
   This fixes issue #11, but order of ACL lines may change.
 - Protocols of "general_permit" are generated for Linux devices now.
 - Protocol with modifiers is no longer valid in "general_permit".
 - Different ID-hosts with identical ID must not terminate 
   their VPN tunnel at a single VPN hub.
 - Fixed handling of automatic groups in add-to/remove-from-netspoc.

3.065     2015-03-13 17:59:49+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Programs 'remove-from-netspoc' and 'add-to-netspoc' have been added.
   Use them to automatically change elements of groups and rules.
   Try option '-man' to see the manual page.
 - Program 'print-group' no longer prints host ranges as subnets.
 - Fixed program 'print-service'.
 - No longer support unmanaged router in 'link' attribute of aggregate.
 - Better error message for inconsistent area definition in loop.
 - Better error message for inconsistent NAT definition in loop.

3.064     2015-02-24 13:51:47+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Internal processing of crypto tunnels has been improved.
   This gives more than 10% faster runtime for
   configurations with many crypto tunnels.
 - Internal storage of expanded rules has been improved.
   This gives about 22% lower memory usage.
 - No longer support attribute 'tunnel_all'.
 - No longer support config option 'area_ignore_crypto'.

3.063     2015-02-06 16:28:34+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Reject all rules which traverse a path where hidden/dynamic NAT is
   enabled first and disabled later.
   This additional check costs about 1% runtime performance.
 - Improved runtime performance by about 20% in error check mode, 
   where no code is generated.

3.062     2015-01-27 11:45:34+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Removed global attribute 'policy_distribution_point' at host.
   Use attribute 'policy_distribution_point' at router or area instead.
 - Attribute 'tunnel_all' is optional and unused now.
   Will be invalid in next version.
 - Config option 'area_ignore_crypto' is enabled by default now.
   Will be removed in next version.
 - No longer guess route for crypto software clients    
   Virtual router of software clients must no longer be directly
   connected with VPN router. Some other router must be placed in
   between now. This router will be used as next hop when reaching
   tunnelled software client network.
 - Ignore blocked crypto interface when checking secondary optimization.
 - Handle grouped NAT tags more restrictive.
   Restrict use of hidden NAT tag together with grouped NAT tags:
   - Don't allow other hidden NAT tags. Otherwise we can't be sure,
     that shared hidden NAT tag will be activated.
   - Don't allow the same group without shared hidden NAT tag.
     Otherwise the shared hidden NAT tag won't be activated in a NAT domain,
     where non hidden NAT tags are no longer active.
   - But still allow grouped pairs of hidden NAT tags.
 - Fixed nondeterminism in generated code 
   - for devices of model Linux with multiple interfaces and
   - for devices with crypto tunnels of different type

3.061     2015-01-09 10:33:56+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Added different and now optional log modifiers:
   - Simple 'log:x;' for IOS, NX-OS, ASA, ACE.
   - Severities as modifier only for ASA.
   - Modifier 'log-info' for IOS.
   - No logging for PIX.
   - Logging currently not implemented for Linux.
 - Fixed 'log' attribute with object groups.
   'log' attribute is now observed for optimized rule with object groups.
 - Added new config option area_ignore_crypto.
   If set, crypto interfaces aren't traversed when identifiying areas.
   This option is currently off by default and
   will be enabled unconditionally in next version.
 - Removed config options check_owner_extend and check_routing_manual.
 - Fixed handling of path ending at interface with pathrestriction.
 - Allow owner with 'show_all' even if there are multiple toplevel areas.
 - Fixed NAT for encrypted traffic of VPN tunnel. 
   Previously a wrong peer IP was used. 

3.060     2014-12-10 15:17:42+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for setting log severity.
   Logging is changed by a combination of attributes at rules and devices.
   Define one or more lines "log:<tag> = <severity>" at devices,
   where logging should be enabled or changed.
   - <tag> is some valid identifier.
   - <severity> is one of 
     alerts|critical|debugging|disable|emergencies|
     errors|informational|notifications|warnings
   Define attribute "log = <tag1>, ...;" at each rule that needs
   changed logging. A rule with logging for <tag1> is logged at each device,
   where a matching "log:<tag1>" is defined.
   Severity names correspond to well known UNIX log severities.
   'disable' disables logging at devices of type ASA and PIX.
 - Added new router type "managed = routing_only".
   This will generate only static routes and no ACLs.
   A device with "routing_only" doesn't split a security zone. 
   Rules with only a routes_only device in between are ignored with 
   warning "Unenforceable rule". 
   Hence, for traffic inside a security zone no static routes are generated. 
   These have to be added manually in file "raw/<device>".

3.059     2014-12-04 15:55:12+01:00 Europe/Berlin

 - New syntax: Element of attribute 'watchers' of owner A is allowed
   to reference some other owner B. In this case all admins and
   watchers of B are added to watchers of A.
 - Fixed two bugs in secondary optimization, 
   where different NAT is applied to network and supernet.
 - Added more consistency checks for networks having NAT 
   and that are in subnet relation
 - Changed default for option --check_routing_manual from 0 to 1.
 - Enhanced program 'cut-netspoc'.

3.058     2014-11-05 15:01:23 Europe/Berlin

 - Added new attribute 'routing=dynamic'.
   This should be used at interface level. It has the same effect as
   'routing=manual', but the new name shows more clearly, that the
   route isn't configured manually but by some routing protocol.
 - Attribute 'routing=manual' has been restricted.
   It is no longer allowed as attribute of interface, but still at
   router. The restriction of 'routing=manual' must be enabled by new
   config option 'check_routing_manual'. This option will be removed in
   the next but one release and the check will be fully enabled then.
 - Added new attribute 'extend_unbounded' at owner.
   Until now, check for inconsistent extended owners was disabled
   globally by default. This check should now be enabled with
   --check_owner_extend=1. For individual owners, the check can be
   disabled again using attribute 'extend_unbounded'. Check has been
   improved and a test case was added. Config option
   'check_owner_extend' will be removed in the next but one release
   and the check will be enabled by default.
 - Check for validity of attribute 'show_all' of owner has been fixed.
 - Better error message for ID host with IP range that is not a subnet.

3.057     2014-11-03 10:17:30 Europe/Berlin

 - Owner with attribute 'extend_only' must only be used at area.
 - Internal Attribute {extended_owner} is calculated for use in Netspoc-Web.
 - Command "rename-netspoc" now also ignores all hidden files.
 - More error checks.

3.056     2014-10-22 14:04:55 Europe/Berlin

 - Reduced internal size of expanded rules, 
   giving better performance for large rule sets:
   ~ 10% faster
   ~ 5% less memory

3.055     2014-10-07 15:12:47 Europe/Berlin

 - Attribute 'admins' of owner is optional now if 'extend_only' is set.
   But in this case some 'watchers' must be defined.
 - Fixed check for interface and auto-interface together in intersection.
   - Check auto-interface from network as well.
   - No longer reject those interfaces inside a union of values.
 - Fixed check for pathrestriction at group of routers with virtual IP.
   Pathrestriction is allowed now if it applies to all routers of such 
   a group.
 - Warn when inheriting useless 'router_attributes' or NAT definitions.
 - Fixed command misc/anonymize to support newer features of Netspoc.

3.054     2014-09-16 18:48:58 Europe/Berlin

 - Extended valid names and handling of ID hosts. 
   Previously, the name needed to contain a '@' and 
   was always checked against the 'ea' field of the certificate.
   Now a name without '@' is also valid. It is checked against some 
   other subject-name of the certificate.
   Use the new attribute 'check-subject-name' inside 'radius_attributes' 
   to configure the to be checked subject-name.
 - No longer ignore private configuration contexts (*.private) 
   in subdirectories.
   But nested private configuration contexts are still rejected.
 - Fixed NAT data for export to NetspocWeb
   by removing needless entries from no_nat_set.
 - Fixed command "print-group". It works for hosts again.

3.053     2014-08-18 17:48:33 Europe/Berlin

 - Added new attribute 'inclusive_border'.  
   With this attribute, the router of the border interface is part of
   the area. The area starts at the router attached to the border
   interface.

3.052     2014-07-09 15:38:32 Europe/Berlin

 - Again fixed 'owner' attribute at 'vip' interface.

3.051     2014-07-09 14:21:06 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed 'owner' attribute at 'vip' interface.

3.050     2014-07-07 10:08:39 Europe/Berlin

 - Allow 'owner' attribute at 'vip' interface.
 - Simplified syntax of IP addresses:
   Valid: "ip = ip/prefixlen;"
   Now invalid: "ip = ip; mask = mask;", "ip = ip/mask;"
 - Fixed check for inconsistent NAT in loop.
 - Fixed minor bug in path_walk at pathrestriction at exit of loop.

3.049     2014-06-13 09:36:41 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed bad optimization that removed route to subnet.
   Be networks N1 < N2 < N3 in subnet relation.
   Static route for N1, N3 having next hop H1, N2 having next hop H2.
   Route to N1 must not be removed as redundant to N3.
   Otherwise, traffic to N1 would be routed to H2 by mistake.
   This must also be observed if N3 is a default route.

3.048     2014-06-12 09:45:08 Europe/Berlin

 - Performance improvement: Optimized handling for those pathrestrictions,
   that partition a cyclic subgraph.
 - No longer accept an aggregate in rule that encloses a tunnel or
   some ID hosts.

3.047     2014-05-09 15:19:46 Europe/Berlin

 - Implemented mode for faster error checks.
   If netspoc is called without an out-directory,
   code isn't written to STDOUT any longer.
   Only error checks are done.
 - Allow pfs group5 for ASA.

3.046     2014-04-09 17:00:01 Europe/Berlin

 - Unnumbered interfaces are accepted in pathrestriction now.
 - Performace improvements.
 - Netspoc now ignores all hidden files, not only '.' and '..'

3.045     2014-04-01 17:41:47 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed implementation of attribute 'policy_distribution_point' at router.
   A router with multiple matching interfaces wasn't handled correctly.

3.044     2014-04-01 14:56:21 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed implementation of attribute 'general_permit'.
   Previously it generated ACLs for unrelated routers.

3.043     2014-04-01 09:53:55 Europe/Berlin

 - Added new attribute 'strict_secondary'.
   With this attribute, a device accepts only rules which
   - either are optimized secondary 
   - or are simple: 
     - protocol is IP
     - src and dst is either
       network, loopback interface or interface of managed device.
 - Added new attribute 'no_protect_self'.
   With this attribute no deny rules are generated to protect
   interfaces of a managed device. It is assumed that services of the
   device are protected by other means. This attribute is applicable
   to routers of model IOS, NX-OS and ACE.
 - Added new attribute 'policy_distribution_point' at router. 
   Used this to select one of  multiple policy distribution points.
 - Added new attribute 'general_permit' at router.
   This is equivalent to 'global:permit', but applicable to single routers.
 - Both new router attributes can be defined for all routers inside an area 
   using attribute 'router_attributes'.
 - A NAT definition can be given at an aggregate with ip 0/0 now.
   This applies the NAT definition to all networks inside the aggregate, 
   which don't already have a NAT definition.
   Only dynamic and hidden NAT can be used here.
 - Fixed generated route for NX_OS: don't omit trailing /32.
   For NX_OS we generally create "i.i.i.i/32" instead of "host i.i.i.i" now 
   in access-lists and object-groups.
 - Fixed check for missing aggregate rule on intermediate path 
   of Linux router.
 - Improved runtime performance when checking missing aggregate rule
   at router with many outgoing interfaces.
 - Allow managed hosts, bridged and unnumbered network in 'private' parts 
   of topology.
 - Fixed corner cases for NAT in loops.
 - Fixed corner cases for multiple NAT tags at one object.
 - Fixed possible duplicate error message on duplicate area.
 - Fixed value of attribute 'extended_by' (used in export.pl of NetspocWeb).
 - Fixed command line switch '-unused' of 'print-group'. 
   A network is unused only if all contained hosts and interfaces are unused.
 - Ignore disabled network in command 'cut-netspoc'.
 - 'cut-netspoc' prints output, even if errors occured.

3.042     2014-01-06 10:51:30 Europe/Berlin

 - Improved runtime to find and delete redundant reverse rules.
 - No ACL is added to crosslink interfaces of IOS routers which don't filter.
   Previously, an ACL with a single "permit ip any any" was generated.
 - Managed loopback interfaces are excluded from automatic group of networks.
 - Added support for 'managed = local_secondary'.
   This works similar to 'managed = secondary', but only inside a
   cluster of zones, connected by routers with 'managed=local' or
   'managed=local_secondary'. If a rule is already filtered by a
   router with 'managed=local', then a router with
   'managed=local_secondary' only checks for source network and
   destination network.
 - Added support for crosslinked routers with different filter strenght.
   If devices with different filter strenght are linked together by a
   crosslink network, then omit filter only at crosslink interface of
   weakest device.

3.041     2013-11-28 08:52:14 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for virtual interface with HSRPv2.
 - Fixed program 'print-service' (variable declaration).

3.040     2013-11-27 16:50:52 Europe/Berlin
 
 - Added attribute 'dhcp_server' to interface. 
   This adds an ACL which permits UDP port 67 to the interface.
 - Added attribute 'vip' to interface of loadbalancer. 
   This is used to define a virtual IP similar to a 'loopback' interface. 
   The difference is, 
   - that no 'hardware' attribute is needed and
   - the interface is left out from "protect own interfaces".
   This is currently available for model 'ACE'.
 - Added new program 'print-service' to show expanded rules of a service.
 - Fixed syntax of generated access-lists for ACE.
 - Fixed "protect own interfaces" 
   - check matching aggregates for possible access to interface,
   - protect IOS interface at ASA if both are connected by crosslink interface.
 - Removed pointless warning on overlaps with/at disabled sevices.

3.039     2013-11-12 11:07:43 Europe/Berlin

 - Access to contained managed hosts is implicitly permitted now, 
   if a rule permits traffic to a network or aggregate.
   Support for managed hosts had been added recently. A rule which permits
   access to a network, implictly permits access to hosts of this
   network. Until now, access to each managed host had to be permitted
   explicitly. This was counterintuitive.
 - Added attribute 'server_name' for managed hosts. 
   This attribute has two use cases: 
   1. Change the name of the generated code file. 
      This name will also be checked by Netspoc-Approve.
   2. Define multi-homed severs. Each interface of the server is defined 
      by a single host. All hosts are linked together by using 
      the same name in 'server_name'.
 - Added support to select managed hosts of a network.
   Syntax is: host:[managed & ...]
 - Show warnings for all pairs of redundant rules. 
   Previously, only one larger rule was shown for each redundant rule.
 - Generated code for Linux now excempts loopback packets from connection 
   tracking in table 'raw'.
 - Added preliminary support for Cisco ACE. Activate with 'model = ACE'.
 - Fixed object-group names in generated code for NX-OS 
   with multiple VRF contexts.
 - Fixed host:[...] without keyword 'managed' to include managed hosts.
 - Fixed any:[ip=i.i.i.i/m & any:[...]] to use mask of outer aggregate.
 - Fixed subnet relation between matching aggregates.
 - Fixed souperflous non local ACLs at device with managed=local.
 - Fixed cut-netspoc to correctly use security zones.

3.038     2013-10-21 16:23:09 Europe/Berlin

 - print-group no longer aborts when printing IP address of auto interface, 
   but prints "unknown".
 - print-group now supports option "-quiet".
 - Better error handling.
 - Improved runtime performance when generating reverse rules 
   for stateless routers.

3.037     2013-10-01 18:29:12 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for managed Linux hosts to generate ACLs for servers.
   Example
    host:h = {
     ip = 1.2.3.4;
     model = Linux;
     managed;
     hardware = eth1;
    }
   This creates a file "host:h" with IPTables rules in out-directory.
 - When generating rules for IPTables, the INPUT chain now gets a rule 
   to accept traffic on interface lo: "-A INPUT -j ACCEPT -i lo".
 - Fixed too optimistic secondary optimization, 
   with network S2 in one zone, S1 and N in other zone and S2 < S1 < N.
   (Bug was introduced in v3.035).

3.036     2013-09-24 12:27:39 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed bug with nested implicit aggregates.

3.035     2013-09-24 10:48:16 Europe/Berlin

 - Added support for implicit matching aggregates,
   to denote all matching networks inside an area or inside a zone.
   E.g. any:[ip = 10.8.0.0/16 & area:x]
 - Added new keyword 'has_unenforceable;' to selectively suppress 
   warnings about unenforceable rules.
   - If added to a service, unenforceable rules of this service
     are silently ignored.
   - If added to a security zone (i.e aggregate with mask = 0),
     all unenforceable rules with source and destination inside this zone
     are silently ignored.
 - Bridged network supports attribute 'owner' now.
 - Fixed bug: auto interface of network can be used now.
   i.e interface:[network.x].[auto]
 - Attributes of aggregate are now propagated into all zones of
   a cluster of zones.
 - Fixed endless loop when parsing "network:x={host}"
 - Identity NAT no longer generates NAT rules for device.

3.034     2013-08-28 17:57:24 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed wrongly sorted IP addresses in object-groups introduced in 3.033.

3.033     2013-08-28 16:26:33 Europe/Berlin

 - A NAT definition can be given at an area now.
   This applies the NAT definition to all networks inside the area, 
   which don't already have a NAT definition.
   Only dynamic and hidden NAT can be used here.
   NAT definitions from multiple areas are applied from smaller areas first.
 - The concept of identity NAT has been introduced.
   Use "nat:x = { identity; }' to define identity NAT,
   i.e. the address remains unchanged.
   Identity NAT is used to mask a network from the NAT definition of an area.
 - A bridged network can be given a NAT definition now, but only identity NAT
   is permitted.
 - NAT can be bound to a bridged interface now. 
   Only hidden NAT should be used here.
 - Global NAT isn't supported any longer. 
   This should be migrated to NAT at area.
 - New router attribute 'routing'.
   This value is inherited by all interfaces having no router attribute
   of their own.
 - Permit email address 'guest' for anonymous login in policy-web.
 - No longer allow ports in global permit.
 - Object-groups are reused even if used in ACLs bound to interfaces 
   in different NAT doamains.
 - Fixed check for redundant rules with global permit.
 - Fixed check for useless overlaps. 
   Check is done even if check for duplicate / redundant rules is disabled.
 - Fixed check for unenforceable rules. Don't check disabled services.
 - Ignore bridged interface in check for duplicate routes.
 - Ignore duplicate networks and aggregates in automatic group resulting
   from different interfaces connected to the same object.
 - Mark secondary ip address as 'secondary' in generated code for NX-OS.

3.032     2013-06-24 15:05:25 Europe/Berlin

 - New 'managed = local' option for device that filters only local traffic.
   A list of local ip/prefix pairs is given in new attribute 'filter_only'.
   All attached networks, not filtered by some other non-local
   packet filter, must match some ip of 'filter_only'.
   Only traffic with source and destination matching 'filter_only'
   is filtered. All other traffic passes unfiltered.
   This is implemented by adding deny and permit rules:
   - permit local traffic
   - deny local traffic
   - permit any other traffic
 - Fixed check for unused 'overlaps' declarations.

3.031     2013-05-31 10:15:14 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed check for useless pathrestriction inside security zone.
 - Fixed check for unenforceable rules between security zone with 
   pathrestriction at unmanaged device.
 - Fixed syntax check for aggregate.
 - netspoc now reads from stdin, if no arg is given.
   Filename "-" for reading stdin isn't supported any longer.
 - Fixed performance and tests for perl5.18.0.

3.030     2013-04-24 16:47:17 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed access to layer3 interface of bridged ASA.

3.029     2013-04-17 15:53:38 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed duplicate ACL line from unmanaged virtual interface.
 - Fixed superfluous warning on unused owner.
 - Changed default: check_service_unknown_owner = 0 (was 'warn').
 - Minor fixes with NAT and minimal topology.
 - Moved programs newpolicy and newpolicy.pl to project Netspoc-Approve.

3.028     2013-03-26 12:08:23 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed minor bug: Prevent deep recursion in set_routes_in_zone.

3.027     2013-03-25 13:07:19 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed minor bug: Prevent deep recursion in set_zone1 and set_zone_cluster.

3.026     2013-03-08 11:49:38 Europe/Berlin

 - Fixed minor bug: Handle only managed routers of a VRF.
  This prevents warning messages "uninitialized value".

3.025     2013-03-06 15:19:51 Europe/Berlin

 - Allow mixed managed and unmanaged VRFs on the same device.

3.024     2013-02-19 10:11:28 Europe/Berlin

 - Added attribute 'sub_owner' to service definition.
   Typically, the owner is definied at networks (or hosts).
   A service S implicitly inherits its owner from a network N,
   if S defines access to objects of network N.
   The owner of network N can delegate the user management 
   of a service S to some owner X.
   In this use case, S gets an explicit sub_owner X.
   X is only allowed to change users of S.
   X is not allowed to change the definition of S.
 - Removed support for model VPN3K (Cisco VPN 3000)

3.023     2013-02-04 16:34:46 Europe/Berlin

- Better handling of unnumbered interface at managed device.
- Fixed optimization of virtual loopback interfaces.
- Fixed more nondeterminism in generated code.

3.022     2013-01-17 11:58:31 Europe/Berlin

- Allow a single virtual interface.
- Added support for NX-OS
  - ACLs
  - object-groups
  - routing
  - VRF support
- no longer support syntax srv, policy, etc.
- no longer support syntax admin:xx 
- no longer generate icmp, http, telnet, ssh commands for ASA/PIX

3.021     2012-11-13 14:37:55 Europe/Berlin

- Use email address directly as admins / watchers attributes of owner.
  Old syntax with admin:xx is still supported.
- Support ASA as EZVPN client: model = ASA, EZVPN
  This assumes, that appropriate commands vpdn and vpnclient 
  have been configured manually.
- Allow virtual interface between managed and unmanaged router.
- Again fixed nondeterminism when printing host routes to physical interface 
  of XRRP group.

3.020     2012-10-30 11:51:32 Europe/Berlin

- When generating static routes for an interface of ASA with site-to-site VPN,
  the device needs an explicit route for each peer. 
  This has been implemented.
- Added support for NAT of tunneled IPSec traffic.
- No longer reject NAT for a network located inside the security zone 
  of a network with mask 0 (the Internet).
- New attribute 'alias' for owners.
  This is used to display an alternate / changed name in Netspoc-Web.
- If overlapping host ranges are added to a group, a warning is printed now.
- Joining of adjacent subnets didn't work in some cases. This has been fixed.
- Fixed check for duplicate id at different VPN interfaces.
- Fixed nondeterminism when printing host routes to physical interface 
  of XRRP group.

3.019     2012-09-20 11:02:33 Europe/Berlin

- No longer generate IPSec commands "isakmp identity", "isakmp nat-traversal"
- Removed option warn_pix_icmp_code. ICMP code is ignored silently now.
- Many consistency checks have been moved to an earlier phase 
  of the compilation process.
- Fixed some minor bugs.
- Added more test cases.

3.018     2012-08-15 14:22:45 Europe/Berlin

- Only check aggregates/supernets with mask = 0 for transient any rules.
- Get owner of zone at loopback interface from owner of interface.

3.017     2012-08-10 14:26:49 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug with multiple aggregates having same IP.

3.016     2012-08-09 15:43:38 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed parser for reading ip address in
  any:X = { link = network:Y; ip = i.i.i.i/n; }
- Optimize redundant port for iptables.
  This is necessary for cases where global optimization doesn't work
  because similar rules are applied to different objects which get the
  same IP from NAT.

3.015     2012-06-22 11:31:59 Europe/Berlin

- Introduced new attribute 'detailed_crypto_acl' for crypto definition.
  This changes generated crypto ACL at VPN hub from
    permit ip any <destination networks>
  to
    permit ip <used local networks> <destination networks>
  Used local networks are automatically derived from current filter rules.
  This attribute is only valid if remote device is unmanaged.
  It is used if "any" can't be configured at remote device.

3.014     2012-06-05 10:47:03 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed order of generated ACL from automatic group network:[area:X]
- No longer allow border of area at unmanaged interface
  having pathrestriction. Otherwise we get inconsistent owners 
  for zones having pathrestriction at unmanaged device.
- Introduced new attribute 'show_all' for owner.
  This is used in Netspoc-Web to have an owner which sees 
  the whole topology and all services. This attribute is only valid 
  for the owner of an area which spans the whole topology.
- Added check for useless pathrestriction at unmanaged interfaces.
- Minor bugfixes.

3.013     2012-05-15 11:04:49 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug with duplicate elements in object-groups.
  A pair of redundancy interfaces wasn't detected as identical
  - if these interfaces were loopback interfaces and
  - if the corresponding loopback network didn't have 
    any identical network from NAT or from aggregates.
- Fixed bug with missing networks in automatic group
  if security zone had pathrestriction at unmanaged device.
  Now, network:[any:X] holds all networks inside zone of any:X,
  regardless of pathrestrictions defined at unmanaged devices
  inside the zone.
- Removed recently introduced attribute 'subnet' for hosts.
  It should be replaced by real networks with attribute 'subnet_of'.
- Changed handling of security levels for ASA / PIX:
  - Introduced attribute 'security_level' at interface to 
    explicitly set the security level.
  - Derive security level if interface name is matching 
    'inside' or 'outside'. Previously it had to be equal.
  - No longer abort, if no security level is given, 
    but use value 50 as default.
  - Allow traffic between equal security levels.

3.012     2012-04-24 14:25:46 Europe/Berlin

- Fixed bug with no_in_acl together with crosslink.
  This fixes useless permit rules at interface with attribute 'no_in_acl'
  if a device had both 'no_in_acl' interface and crosslink interface.
  In this case, the crosslink interface now gets ougoing ACL with
  "permit ip any any".
- Two small fixes in check for use of hidden object in rule.
- Bug fix: Copy attribute "routing" to secondary interface.
  Otherwise static routes would be generated for interface with 
  dynamic routing enabled.

3.011     2012-04-23 13:11:16 Europe/Berlin

- Use largest supernet in zone for routing.
  Add largest supernet inside the zone, if available. This is needed,
  because we use the supernet in secondary optimization too. Moreover
  this reduces the number of routing entries. It isn't sufficient to
  solely use the supernet because network and supernet can have
  different next hops at end of path. For an aggregate, take all
  matching networks inside the zone. These are supernets by design.
- network:[<loopback-interface>] results in an interface now.
  The loopback network is never used. This fixes some ACLs.
- Relaxed check for types in intersection of group.
  Different types of objects are permitted in intersection now.
  But interface and auto-interface of same router are still rejected.
- Improved runtime of local optimization.
- Fixed secondary optimization: no longer use a network which has
  subnet in other zones. We must not change to network having subnet
  in other zone, because then we had to do check_supernet_rules for
  newly created secondary rules.
- Improved secondary optimization: Use largest supernet in zone.
- Don't apply secondary optimization to network with ID-hosts.
  This could lead to unwanted permission if software client uses spoofed
  IP address.
- No longer generate reverse rules for ASA,VPN with no_crypto_filter
  ASA,VPN with no_crypto_filter attribute set, use ACL at cleartext interface.
  Hence no reverse rules are needed.
- Allow simple protocols in global:permit.
- Internally renamed attributes and exported global variables,
  e.g. %poliocies -> %services, srv -> prt.
- Removed unused syntax for host:id:user (without @domain)
- Rules using protocol with attribute no_check_supernet_rules 
  aren't checked for transient supernet rules.
- Changed default values for config options:    
  check_service_unknown_owner => 'warn',
  check_service_multi_owner => 'warn',
  Permit and ignore old options check_policy_multi_owner,
  check_policy_unknown_owner to ease migration.

3.010     2012-03-28 15:03:18 Europe/Berlin

- Syntax for aggregates is extended to have an optional ip/mask
  any:X = { link = network:Y; ip = i.i.i.i/n; }
  If no ip is given, it defaults to 0/0.
  This generates aggregated ACLs with ip/mask, 
  effectively allowing all matching networks to pass.
- Automatic group  network:[any:X]  holds all networks matching any:X 
  inside the security zone, where any:X is defined.
- Attribute 'route_hint' of network is changed to 'has_subnets'.
  This allows the network to have subnets.
  Networks with 'has_subnets' can now be used in rules and are allowed 
  to have hosts.
- Improvements in checks for missing rules on path:
  - checks are applied now to all rules having supernets 
    as source or destination.
  - checks for automatically generated reverse rules at stateless devices
    are left out, if there is some stateful managed device on path.
  - if only a single network matches in a zone, it is sufficient 
    to have a rule with this single network. 
    It is no longer required to use an aggregate with the same size 
    as in the original rule.
- The modifier 'no_check_supernet_rules' can be added to protocol definitions.
  This disables check for missing rules for rules having such a protocol.
- Redundant rules from networks in subnet relation are detected now 
  and a warning is given.
- Attribute 'owner' is inherited from a network to its subnets.
- Networks in subnet relation are checked to have consistent NAT definition.

3.009     2012-03-23 14:05:22 Europe/Berlin

- Added support for two or more networks behind EZVPN devices.
- Certificate name is stored now in attribute 'id' 
  of remote tunnel interface and now longer at the remote network.
  Old syntax is still suported.

3.008     2012-03-06 16:53:55 Europe/Berlin

- Added support for anyconnect clients of ASA 8.4.
- Added flag 'disabled' to disable a service.
- Copy raw files to output directory for better integration 
  with Netspoc-Approve.
- Check for unused raw files. 
  Check can be configured using option '-check_raw=0|1|warn'.
- Added option '-check_unused_protocols=0|1|warn'.
- Check overlapping ranges for consistent owner.
- Disabled old syntax 'policy:'.
  Old syntax can still be enabled using command line switch 'old_syntax'.
- Added option '-owner' to command 'print-group'.

3.007     2012-02-20 15:54:32 Europe/Berlin
- Print host NAT commands first if used together with dynamic NAT.
  Print host NAT for ASA 8.4 with line number 1.
- Allow simple protocol descriptions like 'tcp <port>' directly in rules and 
  protocolgroups now.
- Attribute 'type' of virtual interfaces is optional now. If omitted, 
  no code to permit the redunancy protocol is generated.
- New attribute 'subnet' for hosts as alternate syntax to define a range.
  Syntax is "subnet = ip/{prefix|mask}".
- Generalized reading of mask for network and nat.
  Added ip = i.i.i.i/m.m.m.m as valid syntax.
- Disabled old syntax srv, service, servicegroup.
  Old syntax can still be enabled using command line switch 'old_syntax'.
- Prepare migration of keyword 'policy' to 'service'.
  We will change 'policy:' to 'service:'. This version allows both
  keywords interchangeable.
- Fixed bug in parser which allowed accepted names like type:xx:name 
  by mistake.
- Fixed another occurence of bug #108480 in perl versions 5.14.*.

3.006     2012-02-06 14:12:09 Europe/Berlin
- Support new radius_attribute "authorization-required"
  for tunnel-group general-attributes.
- We will migrate 'service' to 'protocol', 'srv' to 'prt', 'servicegroup'
  to 'protocolgroup'. This version allows both keywords interchangeably.

3.005     2012-01-31 16:53:10 Europe/Berlin
- Fixed dynamic NAT for ASA 8.4, use range and host in out-objects.
- Support new radius_attributes 
  authorization-server-group, username-from-certificate 
  for tunnel-group general-attributes. 
- Fixed check for overlap of interface with subnet.
- Added workaround for bug #108480 of perl 5.14 series.

3.004     2012-01-24 18:22:13 Europe/Berlin
- Added support for changed NAT commands of ASA version 8.4.
