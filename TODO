Define type netOrRouter interface{}  more restrictive.

Replace getIpv4Ipv6Routers() with c.allRouters
- c.allRouters is filled in markDisabled
- used in splitSemiManagedRouter: must be called after markDisabled

Merge routingOnlyRouters into managedRouters.

c.routerFragments is only used once in mark-disabled.go
Is it really needed?

Is c.virtualInterfaces really needed?

NAT:
Combine attributes 'hidden' and 'dynamic' to new attribute 'natType'
with integer values staticNAT, dynamicNAT, hiddenNAT.
Move NAT-Network to new type, only used in NAT.
This type inherits type network.
