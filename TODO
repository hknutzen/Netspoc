Do we really need attribute 'zone' in router?
- Is used for loop detection at unmanaged router. Use activePath instead.
- Used as dummy zone for managed routers. Is value nil?

Set attribute 'zoneCluster' also for simple cluster with only one element?
Or use small function to get list of cluster elements.
