Do we really need attribute 'zone' in router?
- Is used for loop detection at unmanaged router. Use activePath instead.
- Used as dummy zone for managed routers. Is value nil?

Set attribute 'zoneCluster' also for simple cluster with only one element?
Or use small function to get list of cluster elements.

Inefficient delElement + delTuple in path-walk.go

Message is misleading:
 err_msg("Networks need to have ID hosts because",
    " $hub_router->{name} has attribute 'do_auth':\n",
 Attribute 'do_auth' doesn't exist.

Do we need attribute routerIntf.crypto?
This is already available in .hub and .spoke.

This check doesn't work reliably:
Error: Must use 'icmp' only with IPv4 in protocol:ICMP
because protocol can be referenced from IPv4 and IPv6 part.

Combine intf.unnumbered, intf.negotiated, intf.tunnel, intf.short, intf.bridged
into one single attribute with enumerated value.

Define type netOrRouter interface{}  more restrictive.
